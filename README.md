This is my first project in javascript using the DOM to manipulate elements of HTML and the CSS. 

First there is the base game that everyone knows.
But I don't really like it especially because when there are two explerienced players then the game will end in a tie.
So I decided to try and add a new game mode to try and stop ties.
My new game is more strategy based adding together the boards of four games to see who can make more 3 in a rows than the other person.

One of the challenges I had to overcome was the scaling of algorithms so they could deal with any size of board. First translating the DOM to JS required an interesting amount of 'for loops'. Secondly, the algorithm to count the points at the end of game especially the diagonals were very challenging. However these were the most enjoyable parts of the project for me.

Tutorial has been added.

More ideas, a module where you take turns to place the boards down at the end instead of having a definitive order.
