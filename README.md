# Noughts and Crosses +
This is my first project in javascript using the DOM to manipulate elements of HTML and the CSS. 
First there is a base game that everyone knows.
But I don't really like it especially because when there are two explerienced players then the game will end in a tie.
So I decided to try and add to that hence the +.
My new game is more strategy based adding together the boards of four games to see who can make more 3 in a rows than the other person.

Challenges I had was the algorithms to scale the game up to a 6x6 board which also kept in mind the option of bigger game boards. First translating the DOM to JS required an interesting amount of for loops, secondly win conditions to check every single combination of 3 regardless of board size especially the diagonals were very challenging. However these were the most enjoyable parts of the project for me.

Tutorial has been finished.

More ideas, a module where you take turns to place the boards down at the end instead of having a definitive order.
