# Noughts and Crosses +
This is my first project in javascript using the DOM to manipulate elements of HTML and the CSS. 
First there is a base game that everyone knows.
But I don't really like it especially because when there are two explerienced players then the game will end in a tie.
So I decided to try and add to that hence the +.
My new game is more strategy based adding together the boards of four games to see who can make more 3 in a rows than the other person.
